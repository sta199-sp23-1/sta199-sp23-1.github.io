## Course learning objectives

By the end of the semester, you will...

-   learn to explore, visualize, and analyze data in a reproducible manner
-   gain experience in data wrangling and munging, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and data visualization
-   work on problems and case studies inspired by and based on real-world questions and data
-   learn to effectively communicate results through written assignments and project presentation
- develop your own question about a data set of your choosing and use techniques from this class to answer the question

## Assessment

The activities and assessments in this course are designed to help you successfully achieve the course learning objectives.
They are designed to follow the **Prepare, Practice, Perform** format.

-   **Prepare**: Includes short videos, reading assignments, and lectures to introduce new concepts and ensure a basic comprehension of the material. The goal is to help you prepare for the in-class activities during lecture.

-   **Practice**: In-class application exercises where you will begin to master the concepts and methods introduced in the prepare assignment. The activities will graded for completion, as they are designed for you to gain experience with the statistical and computing techniques before working on graded assignments.

-   **Perform**: Includes labs, homework, exams, and the project. These assignments build upon the prepare and practice assignments and are the opportunity for you to demonstrate your understanding of the course material and how it is applied to analyze real-world data.

### Application exercises (Practice)

Each lecture, we will work through application exercise (AEs). These serve as notes you will fill in during class mixed with practice exercises.
Exercises which give you an opportunity to practice statistical concepts and code introduced in the prepare assignment.

Because these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on completion, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts. Successful on-time completion of at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade. To submit an AE, you simply need to push your completed AE to the designated repo in GitHub.

### Labs (Perform)

In labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios, with a focus on the computation.
Some lab assignments will be completed in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment.
You are expected to use the team's git repository on the course's GitHub page as the central platform for collaboration.
Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member's relative contribution for each lab.
Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and be submitted for grading in Gradescope.

*The lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.*

### Homework (Perform)

In homework, you will apply what you've learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks.
You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually.
Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and GitHub and submitted as a PDF in Gradescope.

Homework assignments are due at 5:00 PM ET on the indicated due date.

One homework assignment will be dedicated to a *statistics experience*.
The statistics experience is an opportunity to engage with statistics and data science outside of the classroom through podcasts, books, seminars, data analysis competitions, and other activities.
As you complete these experiences, the goal is to consider how the material you're learning in the course connects with society more broadly.

*The lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.*

### Exams (Perform)

There will be two, take-home, open-note exams.
Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you've learned in the course thus far.
Each exam will include small analysis and computational tasks related to the content in the prepare, practice, and perform assignments.
More details about the content and structure of the exams will be discussed during the semester.

### Project (Perform)

The purpose of the [project](project-description.html) is to apply what you've learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-driven research question.
The project will be completed with your lab teams, and each team will present their work in video and in writing during the final exam period.
More information about the project will be provided during the semester.

## Grading

The final course grade will be calculated as follows:

| Category              | Percentage   |
|-----------------------|--------------|
| Homework              | 30% (5% x 6) |
| Labs                  | 14% (2% x 7) |
| Project               | 15%          |
| Exam 01               | 18%          |
| Exam 02               | 18%          |
| Application Exercises | 2.5%         |
| Teamwork              | 2.5%         |

The final letter grade will be determined based on the following thresholds:

| Letter Grade | Final Course Grade |
|--------------|--------------------|
| A            | \>= 93             |
| A-           | 90 - 92.99         |
| B+           | 87 - 89.99         |
| B            | 83 - 86.99         |
| B-           | 80 - 82.99         |
| C+           | 77 - 79.99         |
| C            | 73 - 76.99         |
| C-           | 70 - 72.99         |
| D+           | 67 - 69.99         |
| D            | 63 - 66.99         |
| D-           | 60 - 62.99         |
| F            | \< 60              |

## Course policies

### Academic honesty

**TL;DR: Don't cheat!**

Please abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course:

-   You may discuss individual homework and lab assignments with other students; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with other students. For team assignments, you may collaborate freely within your team. You may discuss the assignment with other teams; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.
-   You may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams. Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved. More details will be given closer to the exam date.
-   **Reusing code**: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.

Any violations in academic honesty standards as outlined in the [Duke Community Standard](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/about-us/duke-community-standard) and those specific to this course will automatically result in a 0 for the assignment and will be reported to the [Office of Student Conduct](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct) for further action.

### Late work & extensions

The due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner.
We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline.
Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.

### Late work

-   Homework and labs may be submitted up to 3 days late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.
-   There is no late work accepted for application exercises, since these are designed to help you prepare for labs and homework.
-   The late work policy for exams will be provided with the exam instructions.
-   The late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.

### Waiver for extenuating circumstances

If there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email the head TA before the deadline to waive the late penalty.
In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation.
This waiver may only be used for once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.

If there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource.
Please let Dr. Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel know if you need help contacting your academic dean.

### Regrade requests

Regrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week of when an assignment is returned.
Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect.
Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered.
Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.

*No grades will be changed after the project presentations.*

### Class recording requests

Lectures will be recorded on Panopto and will be made available to students with an excused absence upon request.
Videos shared with such students will be available for a week.
To request a particular lecture's video, please fill out [the form](https://forms.gle/1ckJVZU9unoxkaJ39).
Please also make sure that any official documentation, such as incapacitation forms, Dean's excuses, NOVAPs, and quarantine/removal from class notices from student health are also uploaded to the form.
