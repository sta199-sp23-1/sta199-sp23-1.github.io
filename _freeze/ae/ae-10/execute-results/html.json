It can be viewed as  \n  - the proportion of times the event would occur if it could be observed an infinite number of times.\n  - our degree of belief an event will happen.\n  \n- An **event** is the basic element to which probability is applied, e.g. the result of an observation or experiment. \n  - Example: $A$ is the event a student in STA 199 is a sophomore.\n  - We use capital letters, e.g. $A$ to denote events.\n  - For any event $A$ and its complement, $A^C$, Pr(A) + Pr($A^C$) = 1.\n\n- A **sample space** is the set of all possible outcomes. Each outcome in the sample space is **disjoint** or **mutually exclusive** meaning they can't occur simultaneously. \n   - Example: The sample space for year is {First-year, Sophomore, Junior, Senior}, each item brackets is a distinct **outcome** from the questionnaire. \n   - The probability of the entire sample space is 1.\n\n## Introduction\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(knitr)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#sta199 = read_csv()\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsta199 = sta199 |>\n  rename(year = `What year are you in school?`,\n         animal = `Choose your favorite`,\n         tv = `Favorite TV`,\n         major = `Probable Major?`)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nFor this Application Exercise, we will look at our newly collected data.\n\nData includes\n\n- `year`: Year in school\n- `animal`: Whether you prefer cats or dogs\n- `tv`: Favorite TV genre\n- `major`: probable major (statistical science or not)\n\n#### Exercise 1\n\nGive two examples of an event from the data set.\n\n\n#### Exercise 2\n\nLet's take a look at favorite TV genre. Note that we have categorized genres so that each person can only have one favorite genre. \n\n- What is the sample space for favorite TV genre? You can use code to identify the sample space. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Exercise 3\n\n- Let's make a table that includes the TV genre, the number of people who prefer each, and the associated probabilities. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Exercise 4\n\nHow large is the sample space of any individual's response? Can we check this in `R`?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Exercise 5\n\n- What is the probability a randomly selected STA 199 student favors cats?\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n- What is the probability a randomly selected STA 199 student is not a senior and prefers dogs? \n \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n- What is the probability a randomly selected STA 199 student is a first year and a statistics major? \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Exercise 6\n\nNow let's make at table looking at the relationship between year and favorite tv.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsta199 %>%\n  count(year, tv)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe'll reformat the data into a **contingency table**, a table frequently used to study the association between two categorical variables. In this contingency table, each row will represent a year, each column will represent a tv show, and each cell is the number of students have a particular combination of year and major. \n\nTo make the contingency table, we will use a new function in `dplry` called `pivot_wider()`. It will take the data frame produced by `count()` that is current in a \"long\" format and reshape it to be in a \"wide\" format. \n\nWe will also use the `kable()` function in the `knitr` package to neatly format our new table.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsta199 %>%\n  count(year, tv) %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = tv, #how we will name the columns\n              values_from = n, #values used for each cell\n              values_fill = 0) %>% #how to fill cells with 0 observations\n  kable() # neatly display the results\n```\n:::\n\n- How many students in STA 199 are juniors and like dramas?\n\n#### Exercise 7\n\nFor each of the following exercises:\n\n(1) Calculate the probability using the contingency table above. \n\n(2) Then write code to check your answer using the  `sta199` data frame and `dplyr` functions. \n\n- What is the probability a randomly selected STA 199 student is a sophomore? \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n- What is the probability that a randomly selected STA 199 student likes anime **or** action/adventure? \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n- What is the probability that a randomly selected STA 199 student is a sophomore **or** likes comedy? \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n- What is the probability that a randomly selected STA 199 student is a sophomore **and** and likes drama?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n## More definitions (next time)\n\n**Population**: the entire group you want to learn about. Often, it's useful to think the population is \"truth\"\n\n**Sample**: Your sample of the population from which you draw inference.\n\n",
