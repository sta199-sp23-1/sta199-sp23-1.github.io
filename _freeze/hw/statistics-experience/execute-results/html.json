Read all instructions.\n:::\n\n\n\nThe world of statistics and data science is vast and continually growing! The goal of the statistics experience assignment is to help you engage with statistics and data science communities outside of the classroom.\n\nThere will be one statistics experience assignment that will count as a homework grade. **The submission for the statistics experience is due on Wednesday, April 26 at 5:00pm on Gradescope. No late work will be accepted for the statistics experience.** You may submit the statistics experience assignment anytime between now and the deadline. \n\nEach experience has two parts:\n\n1️⃣ Have a statistics experience\n\n2️⃣ Make a slide summarizing on your experience\n\n**You must complete both parts to receive credit.**\n\n\n## Part 1: Experience statistics outside of the classroom \n\nComplete an activity in one of the categories below. Under each category are suggested activities. You  do not have to do each one these suggested activities. You are welcome to find other activities as long as they are related to statistics/data science and they fit in one of the six categories. You can email Professor Fisher if there is an activity you'd like to do but you're not sure if it qualifies for the statistics experience.\n\n### Category 1: Attend a talk or conference\n\nAttend an talk, panel, or conference related to statistics or data science. If you are attending a single talk or panel, it must be **<u>at least 30 minutes</u>** to count towards the statistics experience. The event can be in-person or online. \n\n\n### Category 2: Talk with a statistician/ data scientist\n\nTalk with someone who uses statistics in their daily work. This could include a professor, professional in industry, graduate student, etc. \n\n### Category 3: Listen to a podcast / watch video\n\nListen to a podcast or watch a video about statistics and data science. The podcast or video must be **<u>at least 30 minutes</u>** to count towards the statistics experience. A few suggestions are below: \n\n- [Stats + Stories Podcast](https://statsandstories.net/)\n- [Causal Inference Podcast](https://casualinfer.libsyn.com/)\n- [FiveThirtyEight Model Talk](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/model-talk/)\n- [rstudio::global 2021 talks](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/)\n- [rstudio::conf 2020 talks](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2020/)\n\n\nThis list is not exhaustive. You may listen to other podcasts or watch other statistics/data science videos not included on this list. Ask your professor if you are unsure whether a particular podcast or video will count towards the statistics experience.\n\n### Category 4: Participate in a data science competition or challenge\n\nParticipate in a statistics or data science competition. You can participate individually or with a team. Information for an upcoming data challenge is linked below.\n\n- [DataFest 2023 at Duke](https://dukestatsci.github.io/datafest/signup.html) (signups close Friday March 10).\n\n\n### Category 5: Read a book on statistics/data science\n\nThere are *a lot* of books about statistics, data science, and related topics. A few suggestions are below. If you decide to read a book that isn't on this list, ask your professor to make sure it counts toward the experience. Many of these books are available through Duke library.\n\n- *The Signal and the Noise: Why so many predictions fail - but some don't* by Nate Silver\n- *How Charts Lie: Getting Smarter about Visual Information* by Alberto Cairo\n- *The Art of Statistics: How to learn from data* by David Spiegelhalter\n- [List of books about data science ethics](https://teachdatascience.com/bookclub/)\n\n### Category 6: TidyTuesday \n\nYou may also participate in a TidyTuesday challenge. New data sets are announced on Monday afternoons. You can find more information about TidyTuesday and see the data in the [TidyTuesday GitHub repo](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). \n\nA few guidelines: \n\n- Create a GitHub repo for your TidyTuesday submission.\n- Your repo should include \n  - The R Markdown file with all the code needed to reproduce your visualization. \n  - In the README file:\n    - Include an image of your final visualization \n    - Write a short summary (~ 1 paragraph) about your visualization\n- The visualization should include features or customization that are beyond what we've done in class . \n- Include the link to your GitHub repo in the slide summarizing your experience.\n\n\n## Part 2: Summarize your experience\n\nMake one slide summarizing your experience. Submit the slide as a PDF on Gradescope. \n\nInclude the following on your slide:\n\n- Name and brief description of the event/podcast/competition/etc.\n- Something you found new, interesting, or unexpected\n- How the event/podcast/competition/etc. connects to something we've done in class.\n- Citation or link to web page for event/competition/etc.\n\n[Click here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O4McwUlZLJCKeDgEr1ek79kscGnjEeUW85Y4HCTI_No/edit?usp=sharing) to see a template to help you get started on your slide. Your slide does not have to follow this exact format; it just needs to include the information mentioned above and be easily readable (i.e. use a reasonable font size!). Creativity is encouraged!\n\n\n## Submission \n\nSubmit the reflection as a PDF under the  **Statistics Experience** assignment on Gradescope by **Wednesday, April 26 at 5:00pm.** It must be submitted by the deadline on Gradescope to be considered for grading.\n",
