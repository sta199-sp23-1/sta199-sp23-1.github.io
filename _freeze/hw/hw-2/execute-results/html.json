6.\n\n## Exercise 4\n\n> \"Let's build us a happy, little cloud that floats around the sky.\"\n\nAre the following two events disjoint?\nWhy or why not?\n\n-   A: Bob Ross paints a `cirrus` cloud\n-   B: Bob Ross paints a `cumulus` cloud\n\nAre the following two events disjoint?\nWhy or why not?\n\n-   A: Bob Ross paints waves\n-   B: Bob Ross paints a windmill\n\n\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nSuppose you randomly select a Bob Ross painting and see that it features a mountain.\nUse Bayes Theorem to calculate the probability this painting also features a river.\nShow your work by using a code chunk as a calculator.\n\nHint: p(mountain \\| river) = 0.39\n\n-   Follow up question: Does Bob Ross paint mountains independent of whether or not he paints rivers?\n    Why?\n    In other words, is event A independent of B?\n    Here we define events:\n\n-   A: Bob Ross paints a mountain\n\n-   B: Bob Ross paints a river\n\n## Exercise 6\n\n> \"However you think it should be, thatâ€™s exactly how it should be.\"\n\nYour turn!\nUse this data to explore a question of your choice about paintings created in the TV show The Joy of Painting.\nYour question should explore the relationship between 3 variables in the data set; at least one of the variables must be one that hasn't been used in exercises 1 - 6.\nYou may use the entire data set or focus the analysis on paintings made by Bob Ross.\n\n-   Clearly state the question you're exploring.\n-   Create 1 - 2 visualizations that can be used to explore the question. Customize the colors of your visualization using some of the colors commonly used in Bob Ross paintings. [Click here](https://sites.radford.edu/~cdc/seansevillair.html) for a list of common Bob Ross hex codes.\n\nHint: [Click here for functions to manually create color palettes in ggplot2.](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_manual.html)\n\n-   Calculate the relevant probabilities needed to answer your question.\n-   Write a short narrative, about 2 - 4 sentences, answering the research question based on the visualization and probabilities. Note: The narrative should not exceed 4 sentences.\n\n# Wrap up\n\n## Reminder:\n\n-   All plots should follow the best visualization practices: include an informed title, label axes, and carefully consider aesthetic choices.\n-   All code should follow the tidyverse style guidelines, including not exceeding the 80 character limit.\n\n## Submission\n\n-   Go to <http://www.gradescope.com> and click Log in in the top right corner.\n-   Click School Credentials Duke Net ID and log in using your Net ID credentials.\n-   Click on your STA 199 course.\n-   Click on the assignment, and you'll be prompted to submit it.\n-   Mark all the pages associated with exercise. All the pages of your homework should be associated with at least one question (i.e., should be \"checked\"). If you do not do this, you will be subject to lose points on the assignment.\n-   Select **all pages** of your PDF submission to be associated with the \"Workflow & formatting\" question.\n\n## Rubric\n\n-   Ex 1: 5 pts.\n\n-   Ex 2: 8 pts.\n\n-   Ex 3: 3 pts.\n\n-   Ex 4: 10 pts.\n\n-   Ex 5: 10 pts.\n\n-   Ex 6: 9 pts.\n\n-   Workflow and formatting - 5 pts \n\n:::callout-note \nThe \"Workflow & formatting\" grade is to assess the reproducible workflow.\n    This includes:\n\n-   linking all pages appropriately on Gradescope\n\n-   putting your name in the YAML at the top of the document\n\n-   committing the submitted version of your `.qmd` to GitHub\n\n-   Are you under the 80 character code limit?\n    (You shouldn't have to scroll to see all your code).\n\n-   Pipes `%>%`, `|>` and ggplot layers `+` should be followed by a new line\n\n-   You should be consistent with stylistic choices, e.g. only use 1 of `=` vs `<-` and `%>%` vs `|>`\n\n-   All binary operators should be surrounded by space.\n    For example `x + y` is appropriate.\n    `x+y` is not.\n:::\n",
