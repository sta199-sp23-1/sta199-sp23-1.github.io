 Go to the [Github Organization page](https://github.com/sta199-sp23-1) and open your `hw3-username` repo\n\n-   Clone the repository, open a new project in RStudio.\n    It contains the starter documents you need to complete the homework assignment.\n\n# Packages\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Data\n\nToday, we will be working with data from [www.openpowerlifting.org](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/).\nThis data was sourced from [tidy tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-10-08) and contains international powerlifting records at various meets.\nAt each meet, each lifter gets three attempts at lifting max weight on three lifts: the bench press, squat and deadlift.\nThe data dictionary for this dataset from tidytuesday is reproduced below:\n\n#### Dictionary\n\n| variable

Let's begin by taking a look at the squat powerlifting records. To begin, remove any observations that are negative for squat. Next, create a new column called `best3_squat_lbs` that converts the record from kg to lbs (you may have to google the conversion). Save your data frame as `ipf_squat`.\n\n-   Using `ipf_squat`, create a scatter plot to investigate the relationship between squat (in lbs) and age. Age should be on the x-axis. Add a linear trend-line. Remove the standard error. Be sure to label all axes and give the plot a title. Comment on what you observe.\n\n2.  Write down the full linear model to predict lift squat lbs from age in $x$, $y$, $\\beta$ notation.\n    What is $x$?\n    What is $y$?\n    Next, fit the linear model. Use the `ipf_squat` data frame.\n    Re-write your previous equation replacing $\\beta$ with the numeric estimates.\n    This is called the \"fitted\" linear model.\n    Interpret each estimate of $\\beta$.\n    Are the interpretations reasonable?\n\n3.  Building on your `ipf_squat` data frame, create a new column called `age2` that takes the age of each lifter and squares it.\n    Save your data frame with an appropriate name.\n    Next, plot squat in lbs vs `age2` and add a linear best fit line.\n    Does this model look like it fits the data better?\n    Is this still a linear model?\n\n4.  One metric to assess the fit of a model is the correlation squared, also known as $R^2$.\n    Fit the age$^2$ model and save the object as `age2Fit`.\n    Subsequently report the $R^2$.\n    Compare $R^2$ of the age$^2$ model to the model from exercise 3.\n    Which model do you prefer?\n\n-   If you were to add body weight as a second predictor to the age$^2$ model, would $R^2$ increase or decrease? Explain.\n\n5.  Starting with the original `ipf` dataframe, filter and mutate the data as we did in exercise 1, but this time filtering for `best3bench_kg` > 0 and creating a `best3_bench_lbs` variable, a `bodyweight_lbs` variable, and a `sex` variable that is a factor rather than a character. Fit an interaction effects model with bodywieght (in lbs) and sex as predictors of best bench press (in lbs).\n    Write down the **fitted model equation** only, replacing $\\hat{\\beta}$ with the fitted estimates.\n    Interpret the $\\hat{\\beta}$.\n\n6.  Visualize the interaction effects model we built in exercise 5. Hint: there should be two lines with different slopes.\n    Bodyweight should be on the x-axis.\n    Add a linear trend-line.\n    Be sure to label all axes and give the plot a title.\n    Comment on what you observe.\n\n7.  Do lifters who fail a drug test perform better or worse at bench press than other lifters?\n    Does this vary across sexes?\n    We'll answer this question in two parts.\n    First, remove all observations from the data frame that have `NA` listed under bench press.\n    Next, create a new column called `doping_status` that takes value `doping` if the lifter failed a drug test and `not doping` otherwise.\n    Save this data frame as `ipf_dope`.\n\n::: callout-hint\nCheck the data dictionary at the top to figure out what variables will help you build the `doping_status` column.\n:::\n\n8.  Using `ipf_dope` from the previous exercise, compute the 5%, 50%, 95% quantiles for bench press across both `sex` and `doping_status`. You can use either bench press in kg or lbs here. With this information, answer the question \"Do lifters who fail a drug test perform better or worse at bench press than other lifters? Is this consistent across sex and quantiles?\"\n\n# Wrap up\n\n## Reminder:\n\n-   All plots should follow the best visualization practices: include an informed title, label axes, and carefully consider aesthetic choices.\n-   All code should follow the tidyverse style guidelines, including not exceeding the 80 character limit.\n\n## Submission\n\n-   Go to <http://www.gradescope.com> and click Log in in the top right corner.\n-   Click School Credentials Duke Net ID and log in using your Net ID credentials.\n-   Click on your STA 199 course.\n-   Click on the assignment, and you'll be prompted to submit it.\n-   Mark all the pages associated with exercise. All the pages of your homework should be associated with at least one question (i.e., should be \"checked\"). If you do not do this, you will be subject to lose points on the assignment.\n-   Select **all pages** of your PDF submission to be associated with the \"Workflow & formatting\" question.\n\n## Rubric\n\n-   Ex 1: 6 pts.\n\n-   Ex 2: 7 pts.\n\n-   Ex 3: 6 pts.\n\n-   Ex 4: 5 pts.\n\n-   Ex 5: 8 pts.\n\n-   Ex 6: 4 pts.\n\n-   Ex 7: 4 pts\n\n-   Ex 8: 5 pts\n\n-   Workflow and formatting - 5 pts\n\n::: callout-note\nThe \"Workflow & formatting\" grade is to assess the reproducible workflow.\nThis includes:\n\n-   linking all pages appropriately on Gradescope\n\n-   putting your name in the YAML at the top of the document\n\n-   committing the submitted version of your `.qmd` to GitHub\n\n-   Are you under the 80 character code limit?\n    (You shouldn't have to scroll to see all your code).\n\n-   Pipes `%>%`, `|>` and ggplot layers `+` should be followed by a new line\n\n-   You should be consistent with stylistic choices, e.g. only use 1 of `=` vs `<-` and `%>%` vs `|>`\n\n-   All binary operators should be surrounded by space.\n    For example `x + y` is appropriate.\n    `x+y` is not.\n:::\n",
