If we add predictors to our model, we will always improve \\(R^2\\) (regardless of whether the predictor is good or not).\nTo see this…\n\noffline example\ntake away: a line can go through any two points, a plane can go through any three points, etc. In general an \\(n\\) dimensional object can go through \\(n\\) points.\n\nFor this reason, \\(R^2\\) is not a good way to select between two models that have a different number of predictors. Instead, we prefer to use Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).\n\n\nAIC\n\\[\n\\text{AIC} = 2k - 2 \\log (\\text{likelihood})\n\\]\nwhere \\(k\\) is the number of estimated parameters (\\(\\beta\\)s) in the model. Notice this will be 1 + the number of predictors. and \\(\\hat{L}\\) is “likelihood” of the data given the fitted model.\nThe likelihood is a measure of how well a given model fits the data. Specifically, higher likelihoods imply better fits. Since the AIC score has a negative in front of the log likelihood, lower scores are better fits. However, \\(k\\) penalizes adding new predictors to the model.\nTake-away: lower AIC is better fit.\nYou can find AIC using glance(fitted-model). (Assuming you named your fitted model fitted-model)"

    "text": "Exercises\nFor all of the following exercises, you should include units on axes labels, e.g. “Bench press (lbs)” or “Bench press (kg)”. “Age (years)” etc. This is good practice.\n\nLet’s begin by taking a look at the squat powerlifting records. To begin, remove any observations that are negative for squat. Next, create a new column called best3_squat_lbs that converts the record from kg to lbs (you may have to google the conversion). Save your data frame as ipf_squat.\n\n\nUsing ipf_squat, create a scatter plot to investigate the relationship between squat (in lbs) and age. Age should be on the x-axis. Add a linear trend-line. Remove the standard error. Be sure to label all axes and give the plot a title. Comment on what you observe.\n\n\nWrite down the full linear model to predict lift squat lbs from age in \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(\\beta\\) notation. What is \\(x\\)? What is \\(y\\)? Next, fit the linear model. Use the ipf_squat data frame. Re-write your previous equation replacing \\(\\beta\\) with the numeric estimates. This is called the “fitted” linear model. Interpret each estimate of \\(\\beta\\). Are the interpretations reasonable?\nBuilding on your ipf_squat data frame, create a new column called age2 that takes the age of each lifter and squares it. Save your data frame with an appropriate name. Next, plot squat in lbs vs age2 and add a linear best fit line. Does this model look like it fits the data better? Is this still a linear model?\nOne metric to assess the fit of a model is the correlation squared, also known as \\(R^2\\). Fit the age\\(^2\\) model and save the object as age2Fit. Subsequently report the \\(R^2\\). Compare \\(R^2\\) of the age\\(^2\\) model to the model from exercise 2. Which model do you prefer?\n\n\nIf you were to add body weight as a second predictor to the age\\(^2\\) model, would \\(R^2\\) increase or decrease? Explain.\n\n\nStarting with the original ipf dataframe, filter and mutate the data as we did in exercise 1, but this time filtering for best3bench_kg \\(>0\\) and creating a best3_bench_lbs variable, a bodyweight_lbs variable, and a sex variable that is a factor rather than a character. Fit an interaction effects model with bodywieght (in lbs) and sex as predictors of best bench press (in lbs). Write down the fitted model equation only, replacing \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) with the fitted estimates. Interpret the \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\).\nVisualize the interaction effects model we built in exercise 5. Hint: there should be two lines with different slopes. Bodyweight should be on the x-axis. Add a linear trend-line. Be sure to label all axes and give the plot a title. Comment on what you observe.\nDo lifters who fail a drug test perform better or worse at bench press than other lifters? Does this vary across sexes? We’ll answer this question in two parts. First, remove all observations from the data frame that have NA listed under bench press. Next, create a new column called doping_status that takes value doping if the lifter failed a drug test and not doping otherwise. Save this data frame as ipf_dope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\nCheck the data dictionary at the top to figure out what variables will help you build the doping_status column.\n\n\n\nUsing ipf_dope from the previous exercise, compute the 5%, 50%, 95% quantiles for bench press across both sex and doping_status. You can use either bench press in kg or lbs here. With this information, answer the question “Do lifters who fail a drug test perform better or worse at bench press than other lifters? Is this consistent across sex and quantiles?”"
