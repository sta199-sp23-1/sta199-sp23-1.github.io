The following pipeline mutates the nobel_living data frame by adding a new variable called country_us. We use an if statement to create this variable. The first argument in the if_else() function we’re using to write this if statement is the condition we’re testing for. If country is equal to \"USA\", we set country_us to \"USA\". If not, we set the country_us to \"Other\".\n\nnobel_living <- nobel_living |>\n  mutate(\n    country_us = if_else(country == \"USA\", \"USA\", \"Other\")\n  )\n\nNext, we will limit our analysis to only the following categories: Physics, Medicine, Chemistry, and Economics.\n\nnobel_living_science <- nobel_living |>\n  filter(category %in% c(\"Physics\", \"Medicine\", \"Chemistry\", \"Economics\"))\n\nFor the following exercises, work with the nobel_living_science data frame you created above. This means you’ll need to define this data frame in your Quarto document, even though the next exercise doesn’t explicitly ask you to do so.\n\nCreate a faceted bar plot visualizing the relationship between the category of prize and whether the laureate was in the US when they won the nobel prize. Interpret your visualization, and say a few words about whether the Buzzfeed headline is supported by the data.\n\nYour visualization should be faceted by category.\nFor each facet you should have two bars, one for winners in the US and one for Other.\nFlip the coordinates so the bars are horizontal, not vertical.\n\n\n\nNow is a good time to render, commit, and push.

Then, answer the question, explaining your reasoning in 1-2 sentences.\n\n\nNow is a good time to render, commit, and push.

    "text": "Data visualization and summary\n\nPlot y vs. x for the dino dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset.\n\nBelow is the code you will need to complete this exercise. Basically, the answer is already given, but you need to include relevant bits in your document and successfully render it and view the results.\nStart with the datasaurus_dozen and pipe it into the filter function to filter for observations where dataset == \"dino\". Store the resulting filtered data frame as a new data frame called dino_data.\n\ndino_data <- datasaurus_dozen |>\n  filter(dataset == \"dino\")\n\nThere is a lot going on here, so let’s slow down and unpack it a bit.\nFirst, the pipe operator: |>, takes what comes before it and sends it as the first argument to what comes after it. So here, we’re saying filter the datasaurus_dozen data frame for observations where dataset == \"dino\".\nSecond, the assignment operator: <-, assigns the name dino_data to the filtered data frame.\nNext, we need to visualize these data. We will use the ggplot function for this. Its first argument is the data you’re visualizing. Next we define the aesthetic mappings. In other words, the columns of the data that get mapped to certain aesthetic features of the plot, e.g. the x axis will represent the variable called x and the y axis will represent the variable called y. Then, we add another layer to this plot where we define which geometric shapes we want to use to represent each observation in the data. In this case we want these to be points, hence geom_point.\n\nggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point()\n\nFor the second part of this exercise, we need to calculate a summary statistic: the correlation coefficient. Correlation coefficient, often referred to as \\(r\\) in statistics, measures the linear association between two variables. You will see that some of the pairs of variables we plot do not have a linear relationship between them. This is exactly why we want to visualize first: visualize to assess the form of the relationship, and calculate \\(r\\) only if relevant. In this case, calculating a correlation coefficient really doesn’t make sense since the relationship between x and y is definitely not linear (it’s dinosaurial)!\nFor illustrative purposes only, let’s calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nStart with `dino_data` and calculate a summary statistic that we will call `r` as the `cor`relation between `x` and `y`.\n\n\n\ndino_data |>\n  summarize(r = cor(x, y))\n\n\nThis is a good place to pause, render, and commit changes with the commit message “Added answer for Ex 2.”\nThen, push these changes when you’re done.\n\n\nPlot y vs. x for the circle dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset. How does this value compare to the r of dino?\n\n\nThis is another good place to pause, render, and commit changes with the commit message “Added answer for Ex 3.”\nThen, push these changes when you’re done.\n\n\nPlot y vs. x for the star dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset. How does this value compare to the r of dino?\n\n\nYou should pause again, render, commit changes with the commit message “Added answer for Ex 4”.\nThen, push.\n\nFinally, let’s plot all datasets at once. In order to do this we will make use of faceting, given by the code below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFacet by the dataset variable, placing the plots in a 3 column grid, and don’t add a legend.\n\n\n\nggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, color = dataset))+\n  geom_point()+\n  facet_wrap(~ dataset, ncol = 3) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\nAnd we can use the group_by function to generate all the summary correlation coefficients. We’ll go through these functions next week when we learn about data wrangling.\n\ndatasaurus_dozen |>\n  group_by(dataset) |>\n  summarize(r = cor(x, y)) \n\n\nInclude the faceted plot and the summary of the correlation coefficients in your lab write-up by including relevant code in R chunks (and give them appropriate labels). In the narrative below the code chunks, briefly comment on what you notice about the plots and the correlations between x and y values within each of them (one or two sentences is fine!).\n\nYou’re done with the data analysis exercises, but we’d like to do one more thing to customize the look of the report."

Here, we mutate() the duke_forest data frame to add a new variable called garage which takes the value \"Garage\" if the text string \"Garage\" is detected in the parking variable and takes the test string \"No garage\" if not.\n\n\n\nduke_forest |>\n  mutate(garage = if_else(str_detect(parking, \"Garage\"),   \"Garage\", \"No garage\"))\n\n\nThen, facet by garage and use different colors for the two facets.\nChoose an appropriate binwidth and decide whether a legend is needed, and turn it off if not.\nInclude informative title and axis labels.\nFinally, include a brief (2-3 sentence) narrative comparing the distributions of prices of Duke Forest houses that do and don’t have garages.

It can be viewed as\n\nthe proportion of times the event would occur if it could be observed an infinite number of times.\nour degree of belief an event will happen.\n\nAn event is the basic element to which probability is applied, e.g. the result of an observation or experiment.\n\nExample: \\(A\\) is the event a student in STA 199 is a sophomore.\nWe use capital letters, e.g. \\(A\\) to denote events.\nFor any event \\(A\\) and its complement, \\(A^C\\), Pr(A) + Pr(\\(A^C\\)) = 1.\n\nA sample space is the set of all possible outcomes. Each outcome in the sample space is disjoint or mutually exclusive meaning they can’t occur simultaneously.\n\nExample: The sample space for year is {First-year, Sophomore, Junior, Senior}, each item brackets is a distinct outcome from the questionnaire.\nThe probability of the entire sample space is 1."

What does this argument do?\n\n\n\n\nAesthetics\nAn aesthetic is a visual property in your plot that is derived from the data.\n\nshape\ncolor\nsize\nalpha (transparency)\n\nWe can map a variable in our data set to a color, a size, a transparency, and so on. The aesthetics that can be used with each geom_ can be found in the documentation.\nHere we are going to use the viridis package, which has more color-blind accessible colors. scale_color_viridis specifies which colors you want to use. You can learn more about the options here.\nOther sources that can be helpful in devising accessible color schemes include Color Brewer, the Wes Anderson package, and the cividis package.\nThis visualization shows a scatterplot of bill length (x variable) and flipper length (y variable). Using the viridis function, we make points for male penguins purple and female penguins yellow. We also add axes labels and a title.\n\nggplot(data = penguins, \n       mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm,\n                     color = sex)) + \n   geom_point() + \n   labs(title = \"Flipper length vs bill length\",\n        x = \"Bill length (mm)\", y = \"Flipper length (mm)\") + \n        scale_color_viridis(discrete=TRUE, option = \"D\", name=\"Sex\")\n\nWarning: Removed 11 rows containing missing values (geom_point).\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to change, for exaple, color or fill for all points regardless of the data, you can pass the argument color = or fill = to the geometry itself. **Properties of the plot that are based on the data must be passed to the aes() function.\n\nExercise 2\n\nCreate a new code chunk and paste the code above into it. Remove the scale_color_viridis layer. Next change the above color to \"steelblue\". Since you are hard-coding the color of all the points, this must happen inside the geometry not the aesthetic. On the other hand, color = sex only works inside aes().\n\n\n\nExercise 3\n\nWhat will the visualization look like below? Write your answer down before running the code.\n\n\nggplot(data = penguins, \n       mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm,\n                     shape = sex)) + \n   geom_point() + \n   labs(title = \"Flipper length vs bill length\",\n        x = \"Bill length (mm)\", y = \"Flipper length (mm)\") + \n        scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE, option = \"D\", name=\"Sex\")\n\n\n\n\nA note on colors\nTo work with the viridis color palettes…\n\nscale_color_viridis() to change color\nscale_fill_viridis() to change fill\nargument discrete = TRUE to use a discrete color palette\nargument discrete = FALSE to use a continuous color palette\n\nTo use your own custom color palettes, you can use scale_color_manual() and scale_fill_manual(), but more on this later.\n\n\nFaceting\nWe can use smaller plots to display different subsets of the data using faceting. This is helpful to visualize \\(>2\\) variables and examine conditional relationships.\n\npenguins |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, flipper_length_mm, color = island)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~ species) +\n  labs(x = \"Bill length (mm)\", y = \"Flipper length (mm)\", color = \"Island\")\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).\n\n\n\n\n\n\npenguins |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~ island) +\n  labs(x = \"Bill length (mm)\", y = \"Flipper length (mm)\", color = \"Species\") +\n  scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE)\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point)."

We first specify the data set we will use with data = flint.\n\nggplot(data = flint)\n\n\n\n\nThe mapping argument is paired with an aesthetic (aes()), which tells us how the variables in our data set should be mapped to the visual properties of the graph.\n\nggplot(data = flint,\n       mapping = aes(x = lead)) # variable(s) we want to look at\n\n\n\n\nWe often omit the names of the first two arguments in R functions. So you’ll often see this written as:\n\nggplot(flint, \n       aes(x = lead))\n\n\n\n\nThe geom_xx function specifies the type of plot we want to use to represent the data. In the code below, we use geom_histogram which creates a plot where each observation is represented by a point.\n\nggplot(flint, \n       aes(x = lead)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can make this plot look nicer by adjusting the number of bins and/or the x-axis.\n\nflint |> # data\n  ggplot(aes(x = lead)) + # columns we want to look at\n  geom_histogram(bins = 50) + # geometry of the visualization\n  xlim(0, 100) # limit the x-axis to a certain range\n\n\n\n\nLet’s visualize some of our summary statistics on the plot.\n\nExercise 4:\nUn-comment the code below and fill in the blank with the mean.\n\nflint |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = lead)) + \n  geom_histogram(bins = 50) + \n  xlim(0,100) #+\n  #geom_vline(xintercept = __, color = \"red\")\n\nAdd another geom_vline with the median.

Simple features have a geometry type. Common choices are shown in the slides associated with today’s lecture.\nSimple features are stored in a data frame, with the geographic information in a column called geometry. Simple features can contain both spatial and non-spatial data.\nAll functions in the sf package helpfully begin st_.\n\n\nsf and ggplot\nTo read simple features from a file or database use the function st_read().\n\nnc <- st_read(\"data/nc_regvoters.shp\", quiet = TRUE)\n\nNotice nc contains both spatial and nonspatial information.\nWe can build up a visualization layer-by-layer beginning with ggplot. Let’s start by making a basic plot of North Carolina counties.\n\nnc |>\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf() +\n  labs(title = \"North Carolina counties\")\n\n\n\n\nNow adjust the theme with theme_bw().\n\nggplot(nc) +\n  geom_sf() +\n  labs(title = \"North Carolina counties with theme\") + \n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nNow adjust color in geom_sf to change the color of the county borders.\n\nggplot(nc) +\n  geom_sf(color = \"darkgreen\") +\n  labs(title = \"North Carolina counties with theme and aesthetics\") + \n  theme_bw() \n\n\n\n\nThen increase the width of the county borders using size.\n\nggplot(nc) +\n  geom_sf(color = \"darkgreen\", size = 1.5) +\n  labs(title = \"North Carolina counties with theme and aesthetics\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nFill the counties by specifying a fill argument.\n\nggplot(nc) +\n  geom_sf(color = \"darkgreen\", size = 1.5, fill = \"orange\") +\n  labs(title = \"North Carolina counties with theme and aesthetics\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nFinally, adjust the transparency using alpha.\n\nggplot(nc) +\n  geom_sf(color = \"darkgreen\", size = 1.5, fill = \"orange\", alpha = 0.50) +\n  labs(title = \"North Carolina counties with theme and aesthetics\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Registered Voters\nThe nc data was obtained from the NC Board of Elections website and contains statistics on NC registered voters as of September 4, 2021.\nThe data set contains the following variables on all North Carolina counties, categories provided by the NCSBE:\n\ncounty: county name\ndem: total number registered Democrats\nrep: total number registered Republicans\nlib: total number registered Libertarians\nunaf: total number unaffiliated\nmale: total number male voters\nfemale: total number female voters\ntotal: total number of registered voters in county\ngeometry: geographic coordinates of the county\n\nLet’s use the NCBSE data to generate a choropleth map of the number of registered voters by county.\n\nggplot(nc) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = total)) + \n  labs(title = \"Number of Registered Voters by County\",\n       fill = \"# voters\") + \n  theme_bw() \n\n\n\n\nIt is sometimes helpful to pick diverging colors, colorbrewer2 can help.\nOne way to set fill colors is with scale_fill_gradient().\n\nggplot(nc) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = total)) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"#fee8c8\", high = \"#7f0000\") +\n  labs(title = \"The Triangle and Charlotte have the Most Voters\",\n       fill = \"# cases\") + \n  theme_bw() \n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges\n\nDifferent types of data exist (raster and vector).\nThe coordinate reference system (CRS) matters.\nManipulating spatial data objects is similar, but not identical to manipulating data frames."

You will also need to install the R packages we’re using as well as have git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the TAs are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you’re working in the containers we have provided for you. If you’re working on your local setup, we can’t guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we’re happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install R 4.2.1: https://cran.r-project.org/\nDownload and install the preview build of RStudio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/\nInstall git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nInstall any necessary packages with install.packages(\"___\")\n\nAnd I’d like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the computing environment we have set up for you. More on that here."

Once again, focus on undergraduates (major_income_undergrad) for this exercise.\n\nFirst, let’s create a new vector called stem_categories that lists the major categories that are considered STEM fields.\n\nstem_categories <- c(\n  \"Biology & Life Science\",\n  \"Computers & Mathematics\",\n  \"Engineering\",\n  \"Physical Sciences\"\n  )\n\nThen, fill in the partial code to create a new variable in our data frame indicating whether a major is STEM or not. Note that you need to figure out the logical operator that goes into ___. Double check that you have successfully created this variable by selecting the variables major_type and major_category.\n\nmajor_income_undergrad <- major_income_undergrad |>\n  mutate(major_type = if_else(major_category ___ stem_categories, \"STEM\", \"Not STEM\"))\n\nIn a single pipeline, determine which STEM majors’ median earnings are less than $55,000. Your answer should be a tibble with the columns major, major_type, and undergrad_median, arranged in order of descending undergrad_median."

Join the major_income_undergrad and the major_income_grad data sets by major_code. Join them in such a way where only rows that include the same major_code from each data set are included. Name the new data set major_income.\nCreate a new variable called grad_multiplier – the ratio of median income of those with a graduate degree divided by median income of those with an undergraduate degree, for STEM majors. The result should be tibble with the variables major, grad_multiplier, grad_median, and undergrad_median. The results should be displayed in descending order of grad_multiplier and display the STEM majors with top 10 grad_multiplier.\nDetermine the number of rows of major_income_undergrad and major_income_grad as well as major_income.

    "text": "Assessment\nThe activities and assessments in this course are designed to help you successfully achieve the course learning objectives. They are designed to follow the Prepare, Practice, Perform format.\n\nPrepare: Includes short videos, reading assignments, and lectures to introduce new concepts and ensure a basic comprehension of the material. The goal is to help you prepare for the in-class activities during lecture.\nPractice: In-class application exercises where you will begin to master the concepts and methods introduced in the prepare assignment. The activities will graded for completion, as they are designed for you to gain experience with the statistical and computing techniques before working on graded assignments.\nPerform: Includes labs, homework, exams, and the project. These assignments build upon the prepare and practice assignments and are the opportunity for you to demonstrate your understanding of the course material and how it is applied to analyze real-world data.\n\n\nTeam work policy\nThe final project and several labs will be completed in teams. GitHub commits will be used to measure individual contribution to the assignment. All group members are expected to participate equally. Commit history may be used to give individual team members different grades. Your grade may differ from the rest of your group.\n\n\nApplication exercises (practice)\nEach lecture, we will work through application exercise (AEs). These serve as notes you will fill in during class mixed with practice exercises. Exercises which give you an opportunity to practice statistical concepts and code introduced in the prepare assignment.\nBecause these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on completion, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts. Successful on-time completion of at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade. To submit an AE, you simply need to push your completed AE to the designated repo in GitHub.\n\n\nLabs (perform)\nIn labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios, with a focus on the computation. Some lab assignments will be completed in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment. You are expected to use the team’s git repository on the course’s GitHub page as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member’s relative contribution for each lab, see team work policy above. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and be submitted for grading in Gradescope.\nThe lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nHomework (perform)\nIn homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and GitHub and submitted as a PDF in Gradescope.\nHomework assignments are due at 5:00 PM ET on the indicated due date.\nOne homework assignment will be dedicated to a statistics experience. The statistics experience is an opportunity to engage with statistics and data science outside of the classroom through podcasts, books, seminars, data analysis competitions, and other activities. As you complete these experiences, the goal is to consider how the material you’re learning in the course connects with society more broadly.\nThe lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nExams (perform)\nThere will be two, take-home, open-note exams. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far. Each exam will include small analysis and computational tasks related to the content in the prepare, practice, and perform assignments. More details about the content and structure of the exams will be discussed during the semester.\n\n\nProject (perform)\nThe purpose of the project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-driven research question. The project will be completed with your lab teams, and each team will present their work in video and in writing during the final exam period. More information about the project will be provided during the semester."

It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with Duke’s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nAcademic honesty: You should be familiar with Duke’s community standard: https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/about-us/duke-community-standard\nBy enrolling in this course, you commit to upholding Duke’s community standard reproduced as follows:\n\nI will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\nI will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and\nI will act if the Standard is compromised.\n\nAny violations in academic honesty standards as outlined in the Duke Community Standard and those specific to this course will automatically result in a 0 for the assignment and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct for further action.\nPlease abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course: - You may discuss lab assignments with other students; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with other students. For team assignments, you may collaborate freely within your team. You may discuss the assignment with other teams; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved. - You may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams. Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved. More details will be given closer to the exam date. - Reusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. Stack- Overflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nLate policy:\nHomeworks and labs can be turned in within 72 hours of the deadline for grade penalty (5% off per day, stacks to 15% by the third day). Exams cannot be turned in late and can only be excused under exceptional circumstances. The Duke policy for illness requires a short-term illness report or a letter from the Dean; except in emergencies, all other absenteeism must be approved in advance (e.g., an athlete who must miss class may be excused by prior arrangement for specific days). For emergencies, email notification is needed at the first reasonable time.\n\nAll exemptions will be handled by course coordinator, Ed Tam, at sta199@duke.edu\nLast minute coding/rendering issues will not be granted extensions.\n\nProcedures for Requesting a Regrade\nEvery effort will be made to mark your work accurately. We are on your side, and want you to receive every point you have worked to earn. However, sometimes grading mistakes happen. If you believe that an error has been made, return the paper to the instructor within four days, stating your claim in writing.\nThe following claims will be considered for re-grading:\n\npoints are not totaled correctly;\nthe grader did not see a correct answer that is on your paper;\nyour answer is the same as the correct answer, but in a different form (e.g., you wrote a correct answer as 1/3 and the grader was looking for .333);\nyour answer to a free response question is essentially correct but stated slightly differently than the grader’s expectation.\n\nThe following claims will not be considered for re-grading:\n\narguments about the number of points lost;\n\n\n\narguments about question wording.\n\nConsidering re-grades consumes time and resources that TAs and the instructor would rather spend helping you understand material. Please bring only claims of type (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) to our attention.\nCommunication: All lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website. Announcements will be emailed to the class through sakai. Please check your email regularly to ensure you have the latest announcements for the course. For quick communication with your peers and the teaching team, see the course slack for general questions and discussion.\nAccessibility: If there is any portion of the course that is not accessible to you due to challenges with technology or the course format, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations. The Student Disability Access Office (SDAO) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments. Students should be in touch with the Student Disability Access Office to request or update accommodations under these circumstances. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive and disability accommodations cannot be provided until a Faculty Accommodation Letter has been given to me. Please contact SDAO for more information: sdao@duke.edu or access.duke.edu."
