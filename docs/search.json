    "text": "Exercises\n\nTo begin, join the data frames. Save your result as ultra. Next, drop all rows without an observed race time_in_seconds. Your final data frame should have 60924 rows and 20 columns. Print the number of rows of ultra to the screen.\nYour friend computes the mean time in seconds it takes participants of 170+ km races to finish. Your friend also constructs a 90% confidence interval and states, “There is a .9 probability that the sample mean race time for races over 170 km is between 130000 and 160000 seconds.” Without running any code, what is wrong with your friend’s statement? Correct the statement as well (without running any code).\nReport the mean race time for races 170 km or longer and construct a 99% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean race time using set.seed(6) and 5000 reps.\n\nNext, check that central limit theorem holds, do you need to make any assumptions? Use CLT to construct a 99% confidence interval. Compare your result to your bootstrap interval. Interpret the interval.\n\nNow, using the same set.seed, calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for mean race time for races 170 km or longer using 5000 reps. What following characteristics changed compared to the interval created in question 3. (Please answer “yes” or “no” to each of the following. If you answer “yes”, explain the change observed.)\n\n\nThe center of the confidence interval\nThe width of the confidence interval\n\n\nDoes the standard error of the bootstrap distribution change when you change confidence levels? Use appropriate code to justify your answer.\n\n\nIn your own words, describe the process of how to create a bootstrap confidence interval. Be specific.\nIdentify at least two anomalies in the data set. For example, if the same runner ran a race in two different countries on the same day, that would be an anomaly. While this example is false, there are indeed real anomalies in the data. For full credit, display your anomaly either via code (printing to screen) or via a visualization. Discuss your findings.\nGiven the race was in Argentina, what is the median age of runners? Can you use Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to construct a confidence interval about this estimate? Explain. If not, construct a 90% bootstrap confidence interval that bounds the median from below. Use set.seed(8) and 10000 reps. Interpret your interval in context.\n\n– Note, this is not a symmetric confidence interval!\n\nA fellow colleague wants your next investigation to be about mean race times in France. They are adamant that we must use 80% confidence intervals when reporting results. In 1-2 sentences, discuss both any potential benefits and concerns you may have with creating a confidence interval with this low of level."
