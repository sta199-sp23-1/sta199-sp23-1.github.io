    "text": "Intro\nParasites can cause infectious disease – but not all animals are affected by the same parasites. Some parasites are present in a multitude of species and others are confined to a single host. It is hypothesized that closely related hosts are more likely to share the same parasites. More specifically, it is thought that closely related hosts will live in similar environments and have similar genetic makeup that coincides with optimal conditions for the same parasite to flourish.\nIn this lab we will see how much evolutionary history predicts parasite similarity."

    "text": "The Data\nToday’s dataset comes from an Ecology Letters paper by Cooper at al. (2012) “Phylogenetic host specificity and understanding parasite sharing in primates” which can be found here. The goal of the paper was to identify the ability of evolutionary history and ecological traits to characterize parasite host specificity.\nEach row of the data contains two species, species1 and species2.\nSubsequent columns describe metrics that compare the species:\n\ndivergence_time: how many (millions) of years ago the two species diverged. i.e. how many million years ago they were the same species.\ndistance: geodesic distance between species geographic range centroids (in kilometers)\nBMdiff: difference in body mass between the two species (in grams)\nprecdiff: difference in mean annual precipitation across the two species geographic ranges (mm)\nparsim: a measure of parasite similarity (proportion of parasites shared between species, ranges from 0 to 1.)\n\nThe data are available in parasites.csv in the data folder."

    "text": "Exercises\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIt may be helpful to designate one team member to work on each of the problems and only edit your designated portion of the quarto document. However, after last week you should have experience resolving merge conflicts. Consider referring back to that lab or asking lab instructors for help if you run into merge conflicts.\n\n\nTo get started, load the data and save the data frame as parasites.\n\nLet’s start by examining the relationship between divergence_time and parsim.\n\nBased on the goals of the analysis, what is the response variable?\nVisualize the relationship between the two variables.\nUse the visualization to describe the relationship between the two variables.\n\nNext, we’ll model this relationship.\n\nFit the model and write the estimated (“fitted”) regression equation.\nInterpret the slope and the intercept in the context of the data.\nRecreate the visualization from Exercise 1, this time adding a regression line to the visualization.\nWhat do you notice about the prediction (regression) line that may be strange, particularly for very large divergence times?\n\nSince parsim takes values between 0 and 1, we want to transform this variable so that it can range between (−∞,+∞). This will be better suited for fitting a regression model (and interpreting predicted values!)\n\nUsing mutate, create a new variable transformed_parsim that is calculated as log(parsim/(1-parsim)). Add this variable to your data frame. Note: log() in R represents taking the natural log.\nThen, visualize the relationship between divergence_time and transformed_parsim. Add a regression line to your visualization.\nWrite a 1-2 sentence description of what you observe in the visualization.\n\nWhich variable is the strongest individual predictor of parasite similarity between species? To answer this question, begin by fitting separate linear regression models predicting transformed_parsim with each of the following predictor variables:\n\ndivergence_time\ndistance\nBMdiff\nprecdiff Do not report the model outputs in a tidy format but save each one as dt_model, dist_model, BM_model, and prec_model, respectively. Then,\n\n\nReport the slopes for each of these models. Use proper notation.\nWould it be useful to compare the slopes in each model to choose the variable that is the strongest predictor of parasite similarity? Why or why not?\n\nRegardless of your answer to exercise 4b, we will also calculate the \\(R^2\\) of each model to help us identify the strongest individual linear predictor of transformed_parsim. \\(R^2\\) measures the percent of the variability in the response that is explained by the model. As you may have guessed from the name, \\(R^2\\) can be calculated by squaring the correlation when we have a simple linear regression model. The correlation, \\(r\\), takes values between -1 and 1, so \\(R^2\\) takes a value between 0 and 1. Intuitively, if r=1 or −1, then \\(R^2\\)=1, indicating the model perfectly fits the data. If r≈0 then \\(R^2\\)≈0, indicating the model is a very bad fit for the data. You can calculate \\(R^2\\) using the glance function. For example, you can calculate \\(R^2\\) for dt_model using the code glance(dt_model)$r.squared.\n\nCalculate and report \\(R^2\\) for each model fit in the previous exercise.\nWould it be useful to compare the \\(R^2\\) in each model to choose the variable that is the strongest predictor of parasite similarity? Why or why not?"
