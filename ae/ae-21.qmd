## Introduction to hypothesis testing

### Is this a fair coin?

We'll record 1 if the coin is "Heads" and 0 if the coin lands "Tails".

```{r fair-coin}
# coin_flips = c()
```

If the coin is fair, what is the probability of seeing the outcome we saw? To answer this question we'll setup a statistical model:

$$
\text{\# heads} \sim Binomial(n, p)
$$

where $p$ is the probability of a heads and $n$ is the total number of coin flips. 

#### Exercise 2

- If the coin is fair, what would $p$ be?

- Using `R`, flip a fair coin 6 times and count the number of heads. Next, repeat this experiment 1000 times and count the proportion of times you observe 6 heads.

```{r compute-probability}
# code here
```

- What is the probability of observing 6 heads in 6 coin flips?


## Hypothesis testing framework

You may not have realized it but you just performed a hypothesis test!

You setup a null hypothesis: $H_0$. The null hypothesis is a hypothesis you set up and then try and knock down. Conceptually, it's the "nothing special is going on" hypothesis. Formally, the null hypothesis makes a **claim** or **assumption** about a population parameter. 

In this case, it was the assumption that the coin is fair. Mathematically, we write this:

$$
H_0: p = 0.5
$$

Conceptually, $p$ is the probability of flipping a head if we flipped the coin infinitely many times.

Since we computed the probability of observing **all heads**, we were fundamentally interested in if $p > 0.5$. This is our alternative hypothesis, $H_A$. In mathematical notation, we write

$$
H_A: p > 0.5
$$

Next, we **simulated under the null**. This means that we simulated what the coin flips would have looked like **if the null was true**. In this context, this means we simulated as **if the coin was fair**.

Finally, we check to see where our actual observed data places under the null distribution. If it's **way out in the tail**, we reject the null. If its not way out in the tail, we **fail to reject the null**.

How can we make "way out in the tail" more precise? Well, it's arbitrary and context-dependent. In some contexts it is popular to use a cut-off of $0.05$. This cutoff is called "the significance level" and is also known as $\alpha$.

#### Exercise 3
 
Assume we continue flipping our coin for a total of 30 coin flips and observe 23 heads and 7 tails. What is the probability of seeing 23 **or more** heads if the coin is fair?

```{r ex-3}
# code here
```


## p-values

You might not realize it, but you just computed a p-value... again!

A p-value is a probability. It's the **tail** probability associated with your alternative hypothesis.

The alternative hypothesis must always relate to the null. Here we had three options:

- $H_A: p < 0.5$, the coin is biased to land tails
- $H_A: p > 0.5$, the coin is biased to land heads
- $H_A: p \neq 0.5$, the coin is biased

Let's look offline at what each one would like here.

#### Exercise 4

Compute the p-value associated with each of the alternative hypotheses above.

```{r}
# code here
```

Make a conclusion based on a significance level of 0.05. In other words, 

- if p < 0.05, reject the null.
- if p > 0.05, we fail to reject the null.

As you can see our conclusion depends on our alternative hypothesis. For this reason, it is important to set up an alternative hypothesis **before** looking at the data.


### Recap 

We were interested in whether or not a coin was fair. We let $p$ be the probability of landing heads. Fundamentally, we were interested in whether or not $p = 0.5$. This was our **null hypothesis**:

$$
H_0: p = .5
$$

and our alternative, was that the coin was biased heads:
$$
H_A: p > 0.5
$$

In one example our data consisted of 30 coin flips and 23 heads. The proportion of heads **that we observed**, $\hat{p} = 23/30 = .77$.

Do these 30 coin flips give us enough evidence to reject the null in favor of the alternative?

To answer this question, we computed the p-value: $Pr(\hat{p} \geq .77 | H_0 \text{ true})$. In words, the probability that our statistic of interest, ($\hat{p}$), is greater than or equal to what we saw given that the null is true.

Notice that the p-value is defined by three things:

- our observed statistic (0.77)
- the null hypothesis ($H_0$) 
- the alternative hypothesis ($H_A$), this tells us *the direction* ($>=$) to shade.

We compared the p-value to some pre-defined cutoff, $\alpha$. In our example we set our cutoff at $\alpha = 0.05$. If p-value $< \alpha$, we reject the null. If p-value $> \alpha$, we fail to reject the null.

### The tidy way

```{r load-flips}
coin_flips = data.frame(one_flip = sample(c(rep("H",23), rep("T", 7)), size = 30))

glimpse(coin_flips)
```


```{r tidy-way-1}
set.seed(2022)
null_dist = 
  coin_flips %>% 
  specify(response = one_flip, success = "H") %>%
  hypothesize(null = "point", p = 0.5) %>%
  generate(reps = 10000, type = "draw") %>%
  calculate(stat = "prop")

obs_stat = 23/30

visualize(null_dist) +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat, direction = "right")

null_dist %>%
get_p_value(obs_stat, direction = "right")
```

p-value of $0.0027 < 0.05$. We reject the null hypothesis that the coin is fair.
