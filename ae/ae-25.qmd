- [project draft report](https://sta199-sp23-1.github.io/project-description.html) due to GitHub today
- Project presentations and repo due Monday lab (by pushing to GitHub)
- Extended deadline: project reports now due Wednesday
- Don't forget about the statistics experience

## Getting started

Create *your* copy of `ae25-username` by clicking [here](ae-25.qmd)


## Today

By the end of today you will...

- critically examine graphics, models and results
- discuss data privacy and redundancy
- analyze a real data example of Simpson's paradox


## Load packages

```{r load-libraries, message = F, warning = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
```

### Guidelines for Discussion

- Respect others. Be charitable towards each other. Speak calmly.

## Data Representation

### Misleading Data Visualizations^[Source: https://humansofdata.atlan.com/2019/02/dos-donts-data-visualization]

- What is the graph trying to show?

- Why is this graph misleading?

- How can you improve this graph?

**Spurious Correlations**^[Source: https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations Content warning: some examples include death or suicide.]

## Statistical modeling

Read, with a critical eye, page 2 and table 1 from [Physicianâ€“patient racial concordance and disparities in birthing mortality for newborns](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.1913405117) and chat with your neighbor. 

## Data privacy

### Web scraping^[Modified from Modern Data Science with R, 2nd Edition]

A data analyst received permission to post a data set that was scraped from a social media site. The full data set included name, screen name, email address, geographic location, IP (Internet protocol) address, demographic profiles, and preferences for relationships. The analyst removes name and email address from the data set in effort to deidentify it.

- Why might it be problematic to post this data set publicly?

- How can you store the full dataset in a safe and ethical way?

- You want to make the data available so your analysis is transparent and reproducible. How can you modify the full data set to make the data available in an ethical way?

### Redundancy

### Discussion questions

- "Simpson's paradox", where conclusions drawn from analyzing subgroups differ from conclusions drawn when the groups are combined. Can you demonstrate Simpson's Paradox with the data below? ^[Source:  https://www.randomservices.org/random/data/Berkeley.html]
