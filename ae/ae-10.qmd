# Today

By the end of today you will 

- have a working understanding of the terms **probability**, **sample space**, **event**, **population** and **sample**.
- compute **probabilities** of **events** from data
- create a contingency table using `pivot_wider()` and `kable()`
- use a contingency table to explore the relationship between two categorical variables.

## Definitions

- The **probability** of an event tells us how likely an event is to occur, and it can take values from 0 to 1, inclusive. It can be viewed as  
  - the proportion of times the event would occur if it could be observed an infinite number of times.
  - our degree of belief an event will happen.
  
- An **event** is the basic element to which probability is applied, e.g. the result of an observation or experiment. 
  - Example: $A$ is the event a student in STA 199 is a sophomore.
  - We use capital letters, e.g. $A$ to denote events.
  - For any event $A$ and its complement, $A^C$, Pr(A) + Pr($A^C$) = 1.

- A **sample space** is the set of all possible outcomes. Each outcome in the sample space is **disjoint** or **mutually exclusive** meaning they can't occur simultaneously. 
   - Example: The sample space for year is {First-year, Sophomore, Junior, Senior}, each item brackets is a distinct **outcome** from the questionnaire. 
   - The probability of the entire sample space is 1.

## Introduction

```{r load-packages}
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
```

```{r load-data}
#sta199 = read_csv()
```

For this Application Exercise, we will look at our newly collected data.

Data includes

- `year`: Year in school
- `animal`: Whether you prefer cats or dogs
- `tv`: Favorite TV genre
- `major`: probable major (statistical science or not)

#### Exercise 1

Give two examples of an event from the data set.


#### Exercise 2

Let's take a look at favorite TV genre. Note that we have categorized genres so that each person can only have one favorite genre. 

- What is the sample space for favorite TV genre? You can use code to identify the sample space. 

```{r tv-sample-space}
# code here
```

#### Exercise 3

- Let's make a table that includes the TV genre, the number of people who prefer each, and the associated probabilities. 

```{r majors}
# code here
```

#### Exercise 4

How large is the sample space of any individual's response? Can we check this in `R`?

```{r response-sample-size}
# code here
```

#### Exercise 5

- What is the probability a randomly selected STA 199 student favors cats?


```{r 5-1}
# code here

```

- What is the probability a randomly selected STA 199 student is not a senior and prefers dogs? 
 
```{r 5-2} 
# code here
```

- What is the probability a randomly selected STA 199 student is a first year and a statistics major? 

```{r 5-3} 
# code here
```


#### Exercise 6

Now let's make at table looking at the relationship between year and favorite tv.

```{r count-yr-major}
# sta199 %>%
#   count(year, tv)
```

We'll reformat the data into a **contingency table**, a table frequently used to study the association between two categorical variables. In this contingency table, each row will represent a year, each column will represent a tv show, and each cell is the number of students have a particular combination of year and major. 

To make the contingency table, we will use a new function in `dplry` called `pivot_wider()`. It will take the data frame produced by `count()` that is current in a "long" format and reshape it to be in a "wide" format. 

We will also use the `kable()` function in the `knitr` package to neatly format our new table.

```{r pivot-wider}
# sta199 %>%
#   count(year, tv) %>%
#   pivot_wider(id_cols = c(year, tv),#how we identify unique obs
#               names_from = tv, #how we will name the columns
#               values_from = n, #values used for each cell
#               values_fill = 0) %>% #how to fill cells with 0 observations
#   kable() # neatly display the results

```
- How many students in STA 199 are juniors and like dramas?

#### Exercise 7

For each of the following exercises:

(1) Calculate the probability using the contingency table above. 

(2) Then write code to check your answer using the  `sta199` data frame and `dplyr` functions. 

- What is the probability a randomly selected STA 199 student is a sophomore? 

```{r 7-1}
# code here

```

- What is the probability that a randomly selected STA 199 student is a statistics major? 

```{r 7-2}
# code here

```


- What is the probability that a randomly selected STA 199 student is a sophomore **or** a statistics major? 

```{r 7-3}
# code here

```

- What is the probability that a randomly selected STA 199 student is a sophomore **and** and a statistics major?

```{r prob-sophomore-cs-2}
# code here

```

## More definitions (next time)

**Population**: the entire group you want to learn about. Often, it's useful to think the population is "truth"

**Sample**: Your sample of the population from which you draw inference.
